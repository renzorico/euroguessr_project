This data science project aims to develop a system that can detect pictures from Google Street View and accurately guess their corresponding locations. By utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques, we will collect a dataset of Google Street View images, preprocess them, extract relevant features, and train a model to learn the relationship between image features and geographical locations. The trained model will be used to predict the location of new images, allowing users to upload images and receive location predictions.
